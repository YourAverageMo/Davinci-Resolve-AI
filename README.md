# Davinci-Resolve-AI
Project to help parse data from video files into timeline markers on davinci resolve

## Project Roadmap

### Step 1: Input Parsing
Create a Python script that reads the JSON input file and parses the relevant information about each event. Store this information in a structured format (e.g., a list of dictionaries).

### Step 2: Timeline Marker Generation
Using the parsed information, generate the corresponding timeline markers for DaVinci Resolve. Utilize the template structure you've defined in the "output" EDL file format. This involves replacing the placeholders with the actual values from the parsed JSON data.

### Step 3: Output EDL File
Write the generated timeline markers to an EDL file. This file will serve as input for DaVinci Resolve, containing the edit decisions based on the trigger events.

### Step 4: DaVinci Resolve Integration
Manually import the generated EDL file into DaVinci Resolve to verify that the timeline markers are correctly applied to the video.

### Step 5: Refinement and Testing
Refine the Python script as needed and conduct thorough testing to ensure it works reliably with different scenarios and edge cases.

### Step 6: Modularization
Organize your code into functions or classes to make it modular and easier to understand. This will facilitate future updates and the transition to a GUI.

### Step 7: GUI Preparation
Investigate GUI frameworks for Python (e.g., Tkinter, PyQt, or Kivy) and start planning the layout and design of the graphical user interface. Consider the elements needed for user input, file selection, and displaying progress or results.

### Step 8: Basic GUI Implementation
Create a basic version of the GUI with the core functionality. This might involve creating buttons to load input files, generate timeline markers, and display results.

### Step 9: GUI Integration
Integrate the core functionality of your Python script into the GUI. This involves connecting the user interface elements to the corresponding functions or methods in your script.

### Step 10: Testing and Refinement
Thoroughly test the GUI, ensuring that all functionalities work as expected. Refine the user interface and code as needed for a smoother user experience.

### Step 11: Packaging and Distribution
Explore options for packaging your Python program as a standalone executable for Windows. Consider tools like PyInstaller or py2exe.

### Step 12: Documentation
Create documentation for your program, including a user guide and any necessary technical documentation for future reference.


### Variables to keep in mind
		<enum_padded>: Formatted with 3-digit padding.
		<enum_not_padded>: same as <enum_padded> but not padded
		
		<marker_start_time>: Placeholder for the start time of each timeline marker.
		<marker_start_time_plus_1_frame>: Placeholder for the start time of each timeline marker plus 1 frame.
		
		<marker_color>: Placeholder for the color of the Resolve function for each timeline marker.

### Files Explanation
Inputs.json is the file generated by the ai containing all the trigger and event data related to the footage in question. i.e. the elimination was triggered at 00:00:01:30 so on so forth

Outputs.edl is the EDL file formate that Davinci Resolve accepts in the timelines>import>import timeline markers from edl... file menu. this particular file was generated as a reference to be use. it demonstrates what the end return main.py must look like.

Outputs Edited.edl is the same as Outputs.edl only the important text has been replaced with variable names for reference to know what must be replaced by main.py
